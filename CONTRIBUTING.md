How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this. While I develope this package for my personal use, I am happy to see it be useful for more people. 

Here are a few things I'd like to do but probably can't with my limited usage scenarios and resoruces:
1. Enable the backtesting and trading of broader strategies 
2. Support more data sources
3. Integrate with more brokers
4. Better execution control, override, and error handling
5. Better strategy performance analysis and visualization
6. More examples and documentation
7. Support more operating systems
8. Other interesting ideas

Minitrade is built on top of `Backtesting.py`. If you contribute to `Backtesting.py`, it's likely the improvoment will find its way into Minitrade. So contribute there if applicable, which helps both packages. If it's more relevant to Minitrade, feel free to contribute here.

Finally, I'd love your feedback on your experience using Minitrade. Let me know in Discussions.

Thanks.
